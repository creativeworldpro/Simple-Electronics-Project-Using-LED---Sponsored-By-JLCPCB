# Simple-Electronics-Project-Using-LED---Sponsored-By-JLCPCB
The NE555 IC is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer, pulse generation, delay and oscillator application.  LED flashers are  semiconductor integrated circuits used to turn on and off groups of light emitting diodes either sequentially. It can be used either to describe working of the circuit or with LED itself. The LED flasher circuit makes use of this amazing component to turn it flash on or off.  The final circuit design can be seen  above. We also thanks to our sponsor JLCPCB ( https://jlcpcb.com/RTA) for sponsoring  us PCB for this project.
