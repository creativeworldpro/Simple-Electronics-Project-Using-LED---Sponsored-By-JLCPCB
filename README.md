The NE555 IC is an integrated circuit used in a variety of timer, pulse generation, delay and oscillator application.
LED flashers are  semiconductor integrated circuits used to turn on and off groups of light emitting diodes either sequentially.
It can be used either to describe working of the circuit or with LED itself. The LED flasher circuit makes use of this amazing component to turn it flash on or off.

 We also thanks to our sponsor JLCPCB ( https://jlcpcb.com/RTA) for sponsoring  us PCB for this project.

LED Flasher Design - 

The schematic of this led flasher  circuit, along with the PCB layout can be seen above. The NE555 IC will be used to make a super bright led flasher circuit. There don’t have any potentiometer to adjust the speed of this LED flasher circuit.



Soldering IC Base and Power Supply Socket - 

Once the PCB is designed and printed, then you can start soldering the IC base and power supply socket, as seen in this image above. Be careful, so that there don’t have any short circuit connection. We utilize JLCPCB  https://jlcpcb.com/RTA) to printout our PCB.


Connecting Resistor and Capacitor- 

After connecting IC base and power socket, we need to connect resistor and capacitor with the circuit. We know that, we use this capacitor - 100µf/25v and this Resistors – 68 KΩ, 1 KΩ to make this circuit. You should not use another parts except this component.


Connecting LED-

We need to remember that all LED should be 5mm and to get perfect effect of this circuit, we need to use different color LED for different side. We use green and blue color LED lights.


Soldering And Cleaning-

We put all electronics component with the circuit. To avoid loose connection, now we need to solder all component leg. During soldering, we need to be careful, because there should not be any short circuit connection. After complete soldering, we need to cut off the extension part of all component leg.
Connecting IC And Power Supply
After complete the above connection, now we connect Timer IC NE555N with the IC base and connect power supply DC-9v with the power supply socket. 

Our circuit is now, completely ready for use. Just plug-in power and enjoy the super effect of this circuit.
